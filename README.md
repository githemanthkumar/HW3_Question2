# HW3_Question2
The code implements a denoising autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras to remove noise from MNIST images. First, it loads and normalizes the dataset before adding Gaussian noise (mean=0, std=0.5) to simulate real-world imperfections. The model architecture consists of an encoder (input: 784 → hidden: 32) and a decoder (hidden: 32 → output: 784), trained with binary cross-entropy loss. During training, the model learns to map noisy inputs to clean outputs. After training, it reconstructs denoised images from noisy test data. The script also visualizes noisy vs. reconstructed images for performance comparison. Denoising autoencoders are practical in fields like medical imaging, where they help remove noise from X-rays or MRIs, improving clarity for diagnosis while preserving essential details.
